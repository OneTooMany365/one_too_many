## Usage

This page will list all reported cyclists deaths on UK roads. This list will contain deaths of all causes, including vehicular collisions, solo collisions, and medical episodes.

I am hoping this page can be kept up-to-date by everyone within the community, so if you wish to contribute, please create a branch and create a Pull Request so we can keep this list as comprehensive as possible.
